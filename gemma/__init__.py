"""gemma — the public SDK surface (v0.1, the embedding seam).

The curriculum builds the harness one primitive per chapter across ``model/``,
``harness/``, and ``ui/``. This package is the curated, versioned surface external
code builds on: ``import gemma`` gives you exactly the agent, its structured
result, tools and their registry, the permission policy, the provider and model
seam, the editable-config door and its schema, and provenance — and nothing else.

The internal module paths (``from harness.agent import Agent``) keep working, so
adopting this façade is opt-in. What is exported here is the contract that
``__version__`` promises stability for; the rest of the tree may move between
chapters. See dev-notes/adr/0001 (why this evolves on its own axis) and 0002
(mechanism here, domain in the consumer).
