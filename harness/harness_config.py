"""The editable surface — every behavioral knob, in one versioned data file.

Until now the harness's behavior was smeared across the code as module-level
constants: the system prompt in ``agent.py``, the clamp size in ``limits.py``,
the compaction prompt in ``compaction.py``, ctor defaults buried in signatures.
Changing behavior meant editing *code*, and knowing which of five files to edit.

This module declares those knobs as a first-class primitive: one JSON file
(``harness_config.json``, next to this module) is the *entire* editable surface.
Want a different prompt, a bigger window budget, another gated tool? Edit the
data file — never the code. That boundary is the point: an editor (human or
model) that may touch only this file can retune the whole harness and nothing
else, and the diff of what changed is the diff of one small file.

Three properties make the surface safe to hand over:

- **Versioned.** The file carries an integer ``version``; bump it on every
  change. Rollback is reverting the file; comparing two behaviors is diffing
  two versions of it. Cheap, because the surface is pure data.
- **Frozen.** ``HarnessConfig`` is a frozen dataclass and every consumer binds
  its values at import, so the real lifecycle is: edit the file, restart the
  process, ``git revert`` the file to roll back — never in-place mutation, and
  no hot-reload.
- **Validated at the door.** ``load_config`` rejects unknown keys, missing
  fields, wrong types, non-positive counts, and a malformed ``@path`` regex —
  loudly, at import. A malformed surface must fail the run, not silently fall
  back to defaults the editor thought it replaced.

Sets travel as JSON arrays and land as ``frozenset``; the ``@path`` attach
pattern travels as a regex *string* and is compiled at its use site
(``context.py``). ``CONFIG`` is loaded once at import and is the single source
of truth — the old module-level names still exist, but only as re-exports.
