"""RunResult — the structured outcome of one agent turn (v0.1, the embedding seam).

For fourteen chapters ``Agent.send`` returned a bare string: the final text, with
everything else — the tool calls, the token totals, whether a code change was
verified — discarded into ``self.messages`` for a consumer to reconstruct. Real
consumers did exactly that reconstruction by hand. This makes it first-class.

``Agent.run`` returns a ``RunResult``; ``Agent.send`` stays returning the final
text (``RunResult.text``), so existing callers are untouched. gemma reports what
happened, never what it means: the ``attributes`` bag on each tool call is left
empty for a consumer to fill with its own taxonomy (see dev-notes/adr/0002).
