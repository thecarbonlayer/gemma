"""Policy — the permission gate as a bound object (v0.1, the embedding seam).

Through ch-14 the gate was a global set of tool names plus a yes/no callback. That
is enough for a human at a REPL, but a consumer driving the agent wants to say, per
agent, exactly which tools may run and under what rule — an allow-list, a
deny-list, read-only, or an approval prompt — without reaching into the loop.

``Policy`` is that rule as one object. The interactive prompt becomes one backend
(``approve``); always-allow and always-deny are others. gemma supplies the
enforcement; the values and any predicate are the consumer's (dev-notes/adr/0002).

Back-compat: ``Agent`` still accepts ``approve=`` and ``approval_required=`` and
builds a ``Policy`` from them when none is passed, so every ch-05 caller is
unchanged.
