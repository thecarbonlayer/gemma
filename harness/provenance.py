"""Provenance — which harness state produced a result (v0.1, the embedding seam).

A consumer that measures the agent (an eval suite, a self-improving loop) needs to
attribute a result to the harness state that produced it. Real consumers were each
shelling out to git and reading the config version by hand. This returns the
primitives; the consumer composes its own fingerprint on top — a verifier hash, a
dirty-tree hash — because those are the consumer's policy, not gemma's
(dev-notes/adr/0002).
